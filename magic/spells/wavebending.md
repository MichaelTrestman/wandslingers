## Tier 1



**illusion/concealment**

\
investing at least ten power points. make a wisdom+intelligence attempt to create a convincing static holographic illusion as large as a sphere of radius 1 foot times the rolled total. It is revealed as an illusion spell by **Reveal Magic** and does not interact with matter, which gives it away if inspected\
You can also use this to create the illusion of an occupied volume being empty, making the contents invisible as long as the background doesn’t need to move.\
\
\
**prereq:** light, darkness\


### Telescope/Microscope

## Tier 2

****

### **Schrodinger Defense**

At the start of your turn, use your action and invest 1 point to create a standing uncertainty wave. Designate two alternative ways in which you could move: Until the spell ends, you are superposed between the two locations. You appear translucent (DC 8 perception to notice, DC15arcana to understand) in both locations.

If you attack or cast a spell that affects another sentient being your position collapses to the alternative of your choice (within range of the desired action).

If one of your positions is attacked, your position automatically becomes the other alternative.
