## Tier 0

### Gravitic Sense

Invest any number of points to sense massive objects within 10ft per point of you., The gravitational connections between objects appear as translucent silvery strands in the magical spectrum.

### Beginner Telekinesis

Telekinesis is the ability to sense and manipulate the gravitational connections that bind spacetime together.

Invest power to push and pull objects against each other, each point allowing you to exert 10 

****



## Tier 1

### Intermediate Telekinesis

**Telekinesis Spell Actions:**

*

\
you can attempt to summon and catch an object by attempting a wis + dex check of DC 10. this can be contested as a reaction, if the attempt AND power die of the challenge are higher the challenge wins.\
\
to make an attack with a levitated object, make a controlled spell attempt. If the attempt equals or exceeds the difficulty of the target and the power of the spell overcomes any physical or magical resistence, the target is hit with the object \
If a target fails a con save against the magnitude of the spell they are injured, incapacitated if hit in the head or if they fail the save by 10.\


### **Razorbeam**

\
A razor thin beam of shearing force extends from your wand, slicing through objects.\
\
To make an attack or precision cut, roll some number of available power die, representing the power of the beam, and a d20 attempt die, adding your dex + wis. If the attempt equals or exceeds the difficulty of the target and the power of the beam overcomes any physical or magical resistence, the target is sliced.\
\
If a person is hit, they must make a con save against the remaining spell power or be injured (or incapacitated if hit in the head). If they fail the save by 10 they are incapacitated

### **Shieldwall**

\
Invest power dice to conjure an invisible disk of force that is two feet per power point in radius, and can be centered up to that same distance away from you. The resistance of the shield is 2X the invested power points.\
If spells or physical effects hit it and do not overcome its power they are deflected. if the spell attack roll was a 1 the spell rebounds on the caster or source.\
\
Can be cast as a Wisdom **reaction** to seeing someone prepare to launch a ranged spell or attack at the caster or an ally within 5 feet per your wisdom score. If your wisdom attempt to cast quickly enough succeeds, roll power dice. If the shield’s power exceeds the remaining power of the spell, the spell is deflected. If the the spell is deflected, and the power of the shield exceeds the power of the attacking spell by 10, or the shield reaction roll exceeds the attack roll by 10, the attack is reflected at the attacker.

### Pocket

Invest at least three points ; as an action, to create a hyperspatial infold ( a ’pocket’  or compartment of space separate from our ’normal’ spatial frame of reference) and place an object or mass quantity (e.g. water) of no more than 1m^3 or 10kg per three points invested.

Subsequently, you can use a bonus action to pop the pocket within 1 m per invested point

you instantly recover all but one of the power points that was invested.

\




## **Tier 2**





### Advanced Telekinesis

if you have at least ten power points are invested in telekinesis but you are not levitating an object, you can telekinetically boost a variety of skilled action:\


* add your wisdom to any grapple, shove, trip, disarm, jump, climb, or acrobatics attempts.
* the spell can also be used as a reaction to certain events:
*
  * seeing an attack made against you within range: wisdom + dex attempt to dodge/deflect the attack.
  * an attempt to disarm, shove, trip, or grapple you: make a wisdom attempt to deflect the attempt, in addition to your contest roll, either can defeat the attempt.
  * falling or seeing someone fall within 30 feet of you, as feather fall
  * Being disarmed or seeing someone disarmed within 30 feet of you: can wisdom + dex attempt to catch the repelled object 
  * seeing a small object being thrown within 30 feet of you: can wisdom + dex attempt to catch it, or wisdom attempt to stop or -5 to reflect it back to sender

### . **Hop**

\
teleport yourself up to 10 feet X the power of the spell, along a direct and unobstructed line, to a point you can see or otherwise directly sense.\
You can make a wisdom reaction attempt to cast this spell to avoid an attack; your attempt must exceed the attack roll, or the attempt fails; in this case you do not expend the power dice.\
\


### **Shieldshell**

\
Invest power dice to conjure an invisible shell of force that surrounds a large or smaller creature or object, granting resistance to magical effects and physical damage equal to the invested power points.\
\
**Sieze:**\
Cause a targets with 1m per point to be held rigidly in place.

**{so spell points are always just 1d10 + cha + effort?? no certainly some others could have other effects.**

**like with fire, you gain a number of on fire points right and then you ahve to deal with the fire or burn, and if you don’t spend your action or if you lose the contest, it increases. if you tie the contest, you don’t take damage and stay the same, if you win, you don’t take damage and it decreases**

## **Tier 3**

### **Expert Telekinesis**

****

### **Encase**

Requirement: one available spacetime pocket

Focus on a completely stationary target

Roll power. If the power minus your distance in meters from the targetexceeds X??? m^2 / power point, the target vanishes into a spacetime pocket

\
\
**Vortex**\
\
Invest power dice to create a gravitational vortex at a point within 2 feet per power point of yourself. You are immune to the effects of the vortex. You cannot move or take any other actions or reactions while creating a vortex. You cannot move the vortex.\
\
The unactivated vortex appears as a silvery bubble one inch in radius per power point. Creatures with passive Arcana+int > +7 (or who try to recognize it and make a DC 17 arcana check ), as well as creatures with experience with vortices, recognize the vortex and try to flee.\
\
From the start of the following turn, you may activate the vortex as a wisdom reaction, bonus or full action.\
\
Beginning when the vortex is activated, all creatures within 2 feet per power point must make a strength save against the power of the spell or succeed on a defensive reaction, or else be sucked towards the vortex along a chaotic, swirling path. This effect occurs regardless of magical or physical resistance.\
\
At the start of each subsequent turn, each affected creature must make an injury saving throw against the power of the vortex remaining after their resistance.\
\
\
\
**Jump**\
teleport to a place either:

you can clearly visualize, up to power dice X 1000 feet distant

are connected to via a whispernet, spell glyph or beacon\
When you teleport, you can take with you everything you are carrying and an additional person per die rolled.\
If all rolled powerdice come up 1 you splinch yourself and all passengers, everyone make an injury save.\
