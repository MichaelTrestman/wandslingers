# Welcome to Wandslingers

## **Design Principles**

Wandslingers is a role-playing game (RPG) system: a set of rules defining a game where each player takes the perspective of one (or more) character in an imaginary world operated by one player who takes on the role of Game Master (GM).

Wandslingers is intended to be a "complete" RPG in the sense that player-controlled characters (PCs), should ideally be able to attempt _anything_ that the player can think of (rather than choosing from a menu of available actions). The rules of Wandslingers provide a way to render any attempted action as a dice roll, where the odds of success depend on the skills and attributes of the player as well as the contextual difficulty of the attempted action.

In addition to the normal sort of actions that are available to humans in the familiar "real" world ("real" from our perspective anyway), wandslingers contains a "magic system", i.e. 

Wandslingers is also a "leveling" or developmental RPG, meaning that generally players begin the game controlling relatively weak characters, and then gradually improve and customize them through opportunities to add new abilities and increase skill and ability modifiers.

As a first-principle of design, the Wandslingers leveling system emphasizes flexibility and non-entrenchment:

#### Flexibility

The design intent of the Wandslingers leveling system is that players can choose abilities, strengths and weakness in combinations that appeal **to the** **player,** in the situation, based on what seems powerful, fun, cool and inspiring to them.

 This is in contract to "class-based" RPG systems, such as the influential Dungeons and Dragons system, which define the allowed combinations of abilities according archetypal templates ("The Wizard" or "The Barbarian") that the developers of the game find inspiring from the tropes of fantasy fiction.

**Nonentrenchment**

The idea here is that the character development choices available to players later in the game should not be overly or arbitrarily constrained by choices made earlier in the game.
