# Action

Insight on conversation:



a player just has a 'conversation' skill, and then they just use whatever tactics they want. an NPC on the other hand, will have some modifiers that apply to the tactics chosen by the player, for example:

someone in love who feels too poor to get married might have a +10 modifier to persuasion pulling at sympathy for love but a -10 for all checks if you display casual wealth, or + 10 subsequently if you give her some money. (these are all pretty crude)



like a fearless knight has a higher DC for intimidation than a puny banker, but the banker might be harder to deceive (particularly about money matters) so write these into rules for the NPC, and then conversation is like a puzzle. much better.







what are the real 'conversation' skills?

no there's just conversation. and then on the other side there are _tactics_ that the NPC is more or less responsive to (modifiers), and different facets of the conversation.

different tactics use the same converation skill but different modifier contests, 





but within conversation contexts:

empathy has a wis and cha and int side

rhetoric has cha and int











further...? and skills precisely shouldn't be married to attributes. the action should map imperfectly onto the skills and attributes! that's way better
